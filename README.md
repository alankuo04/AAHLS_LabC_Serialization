# AAHLS_LabC_Serialization

This problem comes from [CCC 2022](https://xupsh.github.io/ccc/), Serialization in Advanced part. 

The detail of problem is in the link [Serialization](https://github.com/xupsh/ccc/tree/main/problems/serialization).

We design a FAST corner detection accelerator, and calculate by the formula:

**final_mark=mark_fix/t_fix + mark_var/t_var + mark_mix/t_mix**

Use 10ns for the clock period in Synthesis and run Cosimulation, you will get the score 131.4044 + 119.8705 + 64.3904 = **315.6653**.
